The following score has an indent of 1cm but only a single system. Therefore the
indent is deactivated and the score shifted to the left.

\begin{lilypond}[indent=1cm]
  { c' d' e' d' }
\end{lilypond}

The following score has an indent of 1cm set and \texttt{print-only=3-1},
therefore the indented first system wouldn't be at the top of the score. Since
simply shifting the system to the left would create a “hole” on the right side
the score is automatically recompiled without indentation.

\begin{lilypond}[print-only=3-1,indent=1cm]
  \repeat unfold 128 { c' d' e' d' }
\end{lilypond}
