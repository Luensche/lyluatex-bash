\section*{Handling LilyPond Failures -- No Score}

The following block of LilyPond code will cause LilyPond to error out and
produce no score file.  Without the use of \texttt{debug} and \texttt{showfailed} no logfile is produced, nothing is shown in the document, and an error raised.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{lilypond}[debug=false, showfailed=false]
  some meaningless words
\end{lilypond}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{lilypond}[debug=false, showfailed=false]
  some meaningless words
\end{lilypond}

Compiling the same code \emph{with} \texttt{showfailed} will produce a warning
instead of raising an error and prints an information text box in the document.

\begin{lilypond}[debug=false, showfailed]
  some meaningless words
\end{lilypond}

In a final variant, \texttt{debug} is active too, showing different information
in the console and the text box, referencing the log files.

\begin{lilypond}[debug, showfailed]
  some meaningless words
\end{lilypond}

\end{document}
